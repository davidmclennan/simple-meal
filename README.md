# Simple Meal - Xamarin.Forms
A simple recipe app developed in Xamarin.Forms and using data from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

This app has been made possible using:
* [FreshMVVM](https://github.com/rid00z/FreshMvvm)
* [FFImageLoading](https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading)
* [CarouselView.FormsPlugin](https://github.com/alexrainman/CarouselView)
* [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
* [PropertyChanged.Fody](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged)
* [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/)
* [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4)

## Android

Users can find recipes by category with images, videos, instructions and ingredients provided.

To be implemented:
* Search recipes by name
* Save liked recipes

## iOS
I currently do not own a device to run/emulate on iOS. However, this app has been created in Xamarin.Forms with the goal of keeping as little code platform specific as possible and only a few iOS specific changes should be required.
